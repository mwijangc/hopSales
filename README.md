# README - INF 124 PA 3

## General Layout

Very very tightly close to our PA2, (Michael Wijangco, Becky Dinh, and Jules Labador).

## Requirements

##1.

index.jsp was already a jsp, but used ONLY one servlet and tried to build off of it. It is not split dynamically and more "jsp-like".

The recents.java servlet was replaced with recentz.jsp, which implements in a different way to be used.

The formPusher.java servlet maintains its core functionality of pushing a forms data to the backend, but now FORWARDS to the details.jsp servlet, as opposed to statically building and then pushing all at once within formPusher.java.

##2.
    
1 ajax method is used when hovering the individual (Michael, Jules, Becky) cards in order to display dynamically via ajax (through textfiles) the users favorite frog.
